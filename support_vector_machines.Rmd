# Intro to Support Vector Machines (SVMs)

## Linear SVM Classifier

[Intro to SVMs](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/support-vector-machines-r)

### Create some sample data

```{r}
set.seed(10111)
# Make a matrix x, normally distributed with 20 observations in 2 classes/variables.
x <- matrix(rnorm(40), 20, 2)
x
# Make a y variable which is going to be either -1 or 1, with 10 in each class.
y <- rep(c(-1, 1), c(10, 10))
y
# For y = 1, move the means from 0 to 1 in each of the coordinates.
x[y == 1, ] <- x[y == 1, ] + 1 # Alternative for loop notation to increase values in rows 11 to 20 by 1.
x
plot(x, col = y + 3, pch = 19) # pch = 19 creates big visible dots coded blue or red according to whether the response is 1 or -1.
```

### Creating the model

```{r}
# Load the package `e1071` which contains the `svm` function.
library(e1071)
# Turn the data into a data frame and make `y` a factor variable.
dat <- data.frame(x, y = as.factor(y))
dat
# Train the model on the data
svmfit <- svm(y ~ ., data = dat, kernel = 'linear', cost = 10, scale = F)
print(svmfit)
```

"No. of support vectors: 6" are the points that are close tot he boundary or on the wrong side of the boundary.

```{r}
# Plot of SVM that shows the decision boundary.
plot(svmfit, dat)
```

### Make your own plot + Make predictions

The first thing to do is to create a grid of values or a lattice of values for x1 and x2 that covers the whole domain on a fairly fine lattice. To do so, create a function called `make.grid()`. It takes in your data matrix, as well as an argument n which is the number of points in each direction. Here you're going to ask for a 75 x 75 grid.

```{r}
make.grid <- function(data_matrix, size = 75) {
  # Get the range of each of the variables in the data_matrix
  grid_range = apply(data_matrix, 2, range)
  # print(grid_range)
  # Use the seq function to go from the lowest to the upper value to make a grid of length = size
  x1 = seq(from = grid_range[1, 1], to = grid_range[2, 1], length = size)
  x2 = seq(from = grid_range[1, 2], to = grid_range[2, 2], length = size)
  # Make the lattice using expand.grid()
  expand.grid(X1 = x1, X2 = x2)
}
```

Apply `make.grid()` on x and see the first few values of the lattice from 1 to 10.

```{r}
xgrid <- make.grid(x)
xgrid[1:10, ]
```

As you can see, the grid goes through the 1st coordinate first, holding the 2nd coordinate fixed.

Having made the lattice, make a prediction at each point in the lattice.

```{r}
# Use predict() and name the response 'ygrid'.
ygrid <- predict(svmfit, xgrid)
ygrid
# Plot and colour code the points according to the classification so that the decision boundary is clear.
plot(xgrid, col = c("red", "blue")[as.numeric(ygrid)], pch = 20, cex = 0.2)
# Put the original points on the plot.
points(x, col = y + 3, pch = 19)
# scmfit$index tells which are the support points. You can include them in the plot.
points(x[svmfit$index, ], pch = 5, cex = 2)
```

Extract the linear coefficients for the decision boundary.

```{r}
beta <- drop(t(svmfit$coefs) %*% x[svmfit$index, ])
beta0 <- svmfit$rho
```

With these coefficients, you can draw the decision boundary using the equation of the form:

$$\beta_0 + \beta_1 * x1 + \beta_2 * x2 = 0$$

From this equation, figure out a slop and an intercept for the decision boundary. Use the function `abline` with those 2 arguments. The subsequent 2 `abline` functions represent the upper and lower margins of the decision boundary, respectively.

```{r}
# Same as previously
plot(xgrid, col = c("red", "blue")[as.numeric(ygrid)], pch = 20, cex = .2)
points(x, col = y + 3, pch = 19)
points(x[svmfit$index,], pch = 5, cex = 2)
# Add the decision boundary
abline(beta0 / beta[2], -beta[1] / beta[2])
abline((beta0 - 1) / beta[2], -beta[1] / beta[2], lty = 2)
abline((beta0 + 1) / beta[2], -beta[1] / beta[2], lty = 2)
```

## Non-Linear SVM Classifier

[Download the data here](https://github.com/robintux/Datasets4StackOverFlowQuestions/blob/master/ESL.mixture.rda)

### Load the Data

```{r}
load(file = "ESL.mixture.rda")
names(ESL.mixture)
```

For the moment, the training data are x and y. You've already created and x and y for the previous example. Thus, let's get rid of those so that you can attach this new data.

```{r}
rm(x, y)
attach(ESL.mixture)
```

### Visualise the Data

```{r}
plot(x, col = y + 1)
```

The data seems to overlap quite a bit, but you can see that there's something special in its structure. Now, let's make a data frame with the response y, and turn that into a factor. After that, you can fit an SVM with radial kernel and cost as 5.

### Train the Model

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(y = factor(y), x)
str(dat)
nonlinear_svm <- svm(factor(y) ~ ., data = dat, scale = F, kernel = 'radial', cost = 5)
```

It's time to create a grid and make your predictions. These data actually came supplied with grid points. If you look down on the summary on the names that were on the list, there are 2 variables `px1` and `px2`, which are the grid of values for each of those variables. You can use `expand.grid()` (created earlier) to create the grid of values. Then you predict the classification at each of the values on the grid.

### Make the Grid

```{r}
xgrid <- expand.grid(X1 = px1, X2 = px2)
ygrid <- predict(nonlinear_svm, xgrid)
str(ygrid)
```

### Plot the points and colour the decision boundary

```{r}
plot(xgrid, col = as.numeric(ygrid), pch = 20, cex = 0.2)
points(x, col = y + 1, pch = 19)
```

Let's see if you can improve this plot a little bit further and have the predict function produce the actual function estimates at each of our grid points. In particular, you'd like to put in a curve that gives the decision boundary by making use of the `contour` function. On the data frame, there's also a variable called `prob`, which is the true probability of class 1 for these data, at the grid points. If you plot its 0.5 contour, that will give the Bayes Decision Boundary, which is the best one could ever do.

First, you predict your fit on the grid. You tell it decision values equal `TRUE` because you want to get the actual function, not just the classification. It returns an attribute of the actual classified values, so you have to pull of that attribute. Then you access the one called `decision`.

```{r}
# Predict fit on the grid
func <- predict(nonlinear_svm, xgrid, decision.values = T)
func <- attributes(func)$decision
```

Next, you can follow the same steps as above to create the grid, make the predictions, and plot the points.

Additionally, use the `contour` function. It requires the 2 grid sequences, a function, and 2 arguments: `level` and `add`. You want the function in the form of a matrix, with the dimensions of `px1` and `px2` (69 and 99 respectively). You set level equals 0 and add it to the plot. As a result, you can see that the contour tracks the decision boundary, a convenient way of plotting a non-linear decision boundary in 2 dimensions.

Finally include the truth - which is the contour of the probabilities. That's the 0.5 contour which would be the decision boundary in terms of the probabilities (AKA Bayes Decision Boundary).

```{r}
# Plot the points and colour the decision boundary
plot(xgrid, col = as.numeric(ygrid), pch = 20, cex = 0.2)
points(x, col = y + 1, pch = 19)
# Add the "cheat" contour that tracks the decision boundary (not the real boundary)
contour(px1, px2, matrix(func, 69, 99), level = 0, add = T)
# Draw the Bayes Decision Boundary
contour(px1, px2, matrix(func, 69, 99), level = 0.5, add = T, col = "blue", lwd = 2)
```

As a result, the non-linear SVM has got pretty close to the Bayes Decision Boundary.

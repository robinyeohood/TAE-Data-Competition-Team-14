### Load the Data

```{r}
source("prepare_data.R")
tweets <- prepare_data("train.csv", "tweet", "sentiment", 0.005)
```

### Split the Data

```{r}
set.seed(1)
library(caTools)
spl <- sample.split(tweets$sentiment, 0.7)
train <- subset(tweets, spl == TRUE)
test <- subset(tweets, spl == FALSE)

anyNA(tweets) # check for NA entries which might have to be omitted
```

### Training the Model

Before we train our model, weâ€™ll first implement the `trainControl()` method. This will control all the computational overheads so that we can use the `train()` function provided by the `caret` package. The training method will train our data on different algorithms.

```{r}
library(caret)

svm_Linear_1 <- train(sentiment ~ .,
                     data = train,
                     method = "svmLinear")
svm_Linear_1

# trctrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", # 'method' defines the resampling method. "repeatedcv": repeated cross-validation
#                        number = 10, # no. of resampling iterations
#                        repeats = 3 # no. of sets to compute for the method chosen
#                        )
# 
# # This is the full version of the model we want to try out
# svm_Linear_full <- train(sentiment ~ .,
#                     data = train,
#                     method = "svmLinear",
#                     trControl = trctrl,
#                     preProcess = c("center", "scale"), # these help center and scale the data. After pre-processing, these convert our training data with mean value appx. 0 and s.d. appx. 1.
#                     tuneLength = 10 # tuning for the algo
#                     )

# svm_Linear
```

### Testing the Model

```{r}
test_pred_1 <- predict(svm_Linear_1, newdata = test)
confusionMatrix(table(test_pred_1, test$sentiment))
```
